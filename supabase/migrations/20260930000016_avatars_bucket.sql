-- Public 'avatars' bucket for profile headshots.
--
-- The settings page and the contractor profile editor already upload to
-- `avatars/{user_id}/...` and store the public URL in profiles.avatar_url,
-- but the bucket was never defined in migrations. Headshots are shown on
-- public profiles, so reads are public; writes are limited to the owner's
-- own folder.
